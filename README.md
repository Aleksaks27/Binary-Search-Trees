This exercise focussed on balanced binary trees. This is a data structure whose median value represents the root node. All other values are attached to the root as children or grandchildren and arranged in order.

The two classes can create a node and a whole tree. Tree construction starts by removing duplicate values and sorting them. Recursion is then used to append children in the correct order. In other words, no matter what array you provide, a perfectly ordered and balanced tree is produced.

The numerous methods associated with the Tree class allow us to insert or delete data, to traverse trees in different orders and also to find information about data. We can also easily rebalance the tree.
